# MPRAD

Proton radiography is a diagnostic for temporal-resolved and spatial-resolved studies of the electromagnetic field structures in high-energy-density plasmas. In some HED plasma experiments, plasma density can play a significant role in diffusing the proton beams and affecting the prediction and interpretation of the proton images. MPRAD (Multi-MeV proton radiography) is a Monte Carlo and ray-tracing code which which can model the deflection of proton beams in arbitrary electromagnetic fields as well as the diffusion of proton beams by Coulomb scattering and stopping power. This code is based on work by Lu et al. (Review of Scientific Instruments 90, 123503 (2019); https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5123392).
